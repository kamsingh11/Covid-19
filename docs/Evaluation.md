### Evaluation

Our evaluation process included below steps:

 - ***Linear Regression Model***
	 - Our linear regression model gives us an accuracy score of 70.8%
	 - This event related to COVID and demographic analysis has to be analysed on another parameter rather than just a linear model as we cannot get an exact view of these relations in just linear format
	
 - ***Decision Tree Model***
	 - Our decision tree model showed signs of over-fitting in the beginning
	 - Once tuned it gave a better accuracy of 92.4% on train set and 91.8% on test set
