### Project Details

* We are using Jupyter Notebook - ***COVID-19-Death Analysis.ipynb*** to do the data analysis

* The notebook reads a local copy of the data from ***/data/owid-covid-data.csv***

* We have also saved an html version of the Notebook - ***COVID-19-Death Analysis.html*** if someone wants to go through the details without Jupyter Notebook installation

* We are also using GitHub Pages to build a static website for documenting our findings. All the files related to it can be found under ***/docs*** folder
