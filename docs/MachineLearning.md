![Heatmap for the Correlation Matrix](images/HeatMapCorrMatrix)

This heatmap shows the correlation between the different categories. This allows us to see how the different categories may effect each other. We can observe that median_age, aged_65_older and aged_70_older are correlated. We will include only median_age and aged_65_older in our model to avoid noise.
