The data set used for our project can be found [here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/united-states?country=~USA).

The data set obtained for this project is called `Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset` which is a collection of the COVID-19 data maintained by "[Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)". This data set is updated on a daily basis and includes variables such as confirmed cases, deaths, and testing, along with other potential variables.
