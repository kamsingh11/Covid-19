### Project and Team


### Project Details

 - We are using Jupyter Notebook - ***/src/COVID-19-Death Analysis.ipynb*** to do the data analysis

 - The notebook reads a local copy of the data from ***/data/owid-covid-data.csv***

 - We are also using GitHub Pages to build a static website for documenting our findings. All the files related to it can be found under ***/docs*** folder.
	 - The ***/docs/images*** folder contains all the images used for the documentation. These images are snipped from the ***/src/COVID-19-Death Analysis.ipynb*** notebook itself

	 - The ***/docs/html*** folder contains a saved html version of the Notebook - ***COVID-19-Death Analysis.html*** in case someone wants to go through the details without Jupyter Notebook installation
