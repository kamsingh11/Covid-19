## Data Sources (this may be fluid): 
The original link for dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/new-zealand?country=~NZL 

Approach (how you plan to address the research question):

     Data understanding and EDA

     Date Preparation

     Machine Learning (if applicable - supervised, unsupervised)

     Evaluation

Known Issues (problems with predictors, reporting, bias, etc.) - this will develop over time
