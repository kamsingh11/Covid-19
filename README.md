# COVID-19-Death Analysis

## Project Introduction

COVID-19 has been affecting every region of this world and this pandemic has taken the world by storm. This project focuses on the effects of pandemic based on age, region, GDP and such. The dataset obtained for this project is called `Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset` which is a collection of the COVID-19 data maintained by "[Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)". This dataset is updated on a daily basis and includes variables such as confirmed cases, deaths, and testing, along with other potential variables.

## Research Question

Using a daily updated global pandemic data set, we seek to understand how COVID-19 is affecting people around the world. Our primary goal is to perform exploratory data analysis on dataset to understand how different continents with varying GDP and population density are affected by COVID-19, to analyze the total number of cases and total number of deaths and finally to predict the total number of deaths in one of the chosen continents, Europe using predictive analytics.
