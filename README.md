## Project Introduction:

COVID-19 has been affecting every region of this world and this pandemic has taken the world by storm. Therefore, this project focuses on the effects of pandemic based on age, region, GDP and such. The dataset obtained for this project is called  "the complete Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset" which is a collection of the COVID-19 data maintained by "Our World in Data'' at https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus. This dataset is updated on a daily basis and includes variables such as confirmed cases, deaths, and testing, along with other potential variables.

## Research Question:
We seek to understand how COVID-19 is affecting people of various ages, to predict the number of deaths and to determine the effect of GDP on pandemic response and vice versa.

## Relevant Domain Information
### (links to three or more articles that relate to your research question)
https://www.mercatus.org/publications/covid-19-policy-brief-series/cost-covid-19-rough-estimate-2020-us-gdp-impact
This link is an interesting article breaking down data to explain how COVID has affected the GDP of the US. This article goes much further into the economic impact of COVID and does a great job of even breaking down industries. Our data breakdown will be much more broad with a global scope.

This article does an excellent job breaking down labs, hospitalizations, mortality, ethnicity and age. This article is also great because they do age adjustments on their data.

## Data Sources (this may be fluid):
The original link for dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/united-states?country=~USA

Approach (how you plan to address the research question):

     Data understanding and EDA

     Data Preparation

     Machine Learning (if applicable - supervised, unsupervised)

     Evaluation

## Known Issues (problems with predictors, reporting, bias, etc.) - this will develop over time
Upon initial evaluation of the data, there are several countries that do not report on all of the data attributes. This will require us to either fill large portions of missing data or omit large sections of the dataset. 
Conclusion
